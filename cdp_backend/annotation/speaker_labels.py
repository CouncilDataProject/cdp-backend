    """
    Annotate a transcript using a pre-trained speaker identification model.

    Parameters
    ----------
    transcript: Union[str, Path, Transcript]
        The path to or an already in-memory Transcript object to fill with speaker
        name annotations.
    audio: Union[str, Path, AudioSegment]
        The path to the matching audio for the associated transcript.
    model: Union[str, Pipeline]
        The path to the trained Speakerbox audio classification model or a preloaded
        audio classification Pipeline.
        Default: "trained-speakerbox"
    min_intra_sentence_chunk_duration: float
        The minimum duration of a sentence to annotate. Anything less than this
        will be ignored from annotation.
        Default: 0.5 seconds
    max_intra_sentence_chunk_duration: float
        The maximum duration for a sentences audio to split to. This should match
        whatever was used during model training
        (i.e. trained on 2 second audio chunks, apply on 2 second audio chunks)
        Default: 2 seconds
    min_sentence_mean_confidence: float
        The minimum allowable mean confidence of all predicted chunk confidences
        to determine if the predicted label should be commited as an annotation
        or not.
        Default: 0.985

    Returns
    -------
    Transcript
        The annotated transcript. Note this updates in place, this does not return a new
        Transcript object.

    Notes
    -----
    A plain text walkthrough of this function is as follows:

    For each sentence in the provided transcript, the matching audio portion is
    retrieved, for example if the sentence start time is 12.05 seconds and end time is
    20.47 seconds, that exact portion of audio is pulled from the full audio file.

    If the audio duration for the chunk is less than the
    `min_intra_sentence_chunk_duration`, we ignore the sentence.

    If the audio duration for the chunk is greater than
    `max_intra_sentence_chunk_duration`, the audio is split into chunks of length
    `max_intra_sentence_chunk_duration` (i.e. from 12.05 to 14.05, from 14.05 to 16.05,
    etc. if the last chunk is less than the `min_intra_sentence_chunk_duration`, it is
    ignored).

    Each audio chunk is ran through the audio classification model and predicts every
    known person to the model. Each prediction has a confidence attached to it.
    The confidence values are used to create a dictionary of:
    `label -> list of confidence values`. Once all chunks for a single sentence is
    predicted, the mean confidence is computed for each.

    The label with the highest mean confidence is used as the sentence speaker name.
    If the highest mean confidence is less than the `min_sentence_mean_confidence`,
    no label is stored in the `speaker_name` sentence property (thresholded out).
