>> good morning, thank you,

00:04:28.555 --> 00:04:31.424
MADAM Chair, I usually try to
speak directly to the items

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.127
on the agenda but I am so
overwhelmed with what's going

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.464
on this morning at the
alameda county board of

00:04:38.833 --> 00:04:40.833
supervisors meeting that

00:04:42.635 --> 00:04:44.635
started at 9:30 and how it

00:04:45.672 --> 00:04:47.672
relates to you as a body, so

00:04:48.709 --> 00:04:51.143
on that agenda, they have the
homekey shelter operation

00:04:52.212 --> 00:04:54.212
getting 1.7 million dollars,

00:04:54.581 --> 00:04:56.581
st. Mary's center housing

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:01.850
getting 195 thousand dollars,

00:05:02.422 --> 00:05:05.570
centro de la raza raising the
emergency rental assistance

00:05:06.326 --> 00:05:08.326
program from 11.1 million

00:05:08.595 --> 00:05:11.363
dollars to 24.8 million
dollars, and another item on

00:05:12.733 --> 00:05:14.733
the agenda whee centro de la

00:05:16.503 --> 00:05:18.503
raza will be getting 4.1

00:05:18.872 --> 00:05:20.974
million dollars for rental
assistance programs.

00:05:22.576 --> 00:05:24.576
East bay asian youth center

00:05:24.645 --> 00:05:27.113
getting 91 thousand 910
thousand dollars, the lao

00:05:30.684 --> 00:05:32.684
family will be sharing with 7

00:05:33.654 --> 00:05:35.654
other non-profits 8.2 million

00:05:36.724 --> 00:05:39.392
dollars, and I remember
vividly that councilmember

00:05:40.694 --> 00:05:43.196
larry reid was strongly
objecting to centro de la

00:05:44.398 --> 00:05:47.330
raza having the ability to
distribute money related to

00:05:48.101 --> 00:05:50.101
housing and rental assistance

00:05:50.737 --> 00:05:52.838
and legal assistance around
housing eviction because they

00:05:53.908 --> 00:05:55.775
had no relationship with the
african american community.

00:05:57.144 --> 00:05:59.645
He gave them an opportunity
to do outreach and after a

00:06:00.281 --> 00:06:02.281
period of time, he identified

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.618
that they were unable to do
it, but the biggest thing is

00:06:06.987 --> 00:06:09.522
we have money that's going to
non-profits that's coming

00:06:10.624 --> 00:06:13.426
from outside sources and that
money is not being weighed in

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.280
on by you as a body to

00:06:17.364 --> 00:06:19.364
determine equity, fairness

00:06:19.467 --> 00:06:21.835
and other issues, at the same
time, african americans are

00:06:23.404 --> 00:06:25.104
not being served well even
with alameda county.

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:31.430
Thank you.

00:06:32.312 --> 00:06:34.312
>> thank you, MS. Olugbala,

00:06:34.348 --> 00:06:37.316
blair?Frnlt blair beekman
here, thank you for the
special meting today, thank

00:06:38.218 --> 00:06:40.787
you for the words of the
previous speaker, she always

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:45.759
brings up an interesting
point about the needs of the

00:06:45.893 --> 00:06:48.795
african american community in
oakland and she offered an

00:06:50.564 --> 00:06:52.866
interesting list of housing
that is available right now,

00:06:53.233 --> 00:06:55.233
how the african american

00:06:55.769 --> 00:06:57.769
community can be a part of

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:00.740
the future of real bountiful

00:07:02.443 --> 00:07:05.110
choices in the future of
housing we have, good luck

00:07:05.279 --> 00:07:07.279
how that can work out, there

00:07:07.281 --> 00:07:09.730
can be ways to do that, good
luck how we organize
-

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:11.750
ourselves to do that, I

00:07:15.356 --> 00:07:17.356
wanted to quickly comment on

00:07:21.228 --> 00:07:23.620
item 2.2 about a homeless
settlement issue.

00:07:24.398 --> 00:07:26.398
I don't know how long ago

00:07:27.435 --> 00:07:29.435
this issue took place between

00:07:30.971 --> 00:07:33.740
yourselves and a homeless
encampment but it's been

00:07:35.943 --> 00:07:37.944
resolved and thank you that
it's worked out for the

00:07:38.713 --> 00:07:41.548
plaintiffs a bit and they
felt that their human rights

00:07:44.919 --> 00:07:46.919
were a bit abused, and it's a

00:07:47.521 --> 00:07:49.589
learning process why that
actually happens and takes

00:07:50.458 --> 00:07:52.993
place and I think in places
like berkeley and people's

00:07:53.427 --> 00:07:55.427
park, we're going through the

00:07:56.397 --> 00:07:58.565
same thing right now, the
regents hopefully can learn

00:08:02.136 --> 00:08:04.470
some important lessons of
why you have this sort of

00:08:04.839 --> 00:08:06.839
item on your jep da today and

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.442
I hope a thoughtful ro kress
can continue at people's park

00:08:10.178 --> 00:08:12.479
as with this issue, that
these things can always take

00:08:12.781 --> 00:08:15.515
their time, we don't ever
have to rush these things as

00:08:16.117 --> 00:08:18.117
a matter of die sxlog

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:21.588
communication for all sides,
so thank you that you have

00:08:23.324 --> 00:08:26.126
offered this item 2.2 on your
agenda today.

00:08:26.594 --> 00:08:28.594
>> thank you for your

00:08:30.733 --> 00:08:32.733
comments, we have a phone

00:08:34.268 --> 00:08:36.268
number ending in 9932 up next.

00:08:36.971 --> 00:08:39.272
Mriez press star 6 to unmute
yourself, good morning.

00:08:39.907 --> 00:08:41.775
>> good morning, black
homeless advocate, nino

00:08:43.745 --> 00:08:46.446
parker, as you know, I want
to start off, I'm hoping we

00:08:46.914 --> 00:08:49.382
can get together some black
workers and poll workers

00:08:52.553 --> 00:08:55.422
before this election, I want
you to say keep fight thing

00:08:56.191 --> 00:08:58.191
good fielgt, why do old black

00:08:58.326 --> 00:09:00.694
men have to pay 30% of their
income, the only people

00:09:01.562 --> 00:09:03.562
paying homeless rent is old

00:09:04.766 --> 00:09:06.766
black men, I would also like

00:09:09.103 --> 00:09:11.103
to quickly mention the fact

00:09:15.109 --> 00:09:17.109
that I'm taking some work

00:09:17.479 --> 00:09:19.479
medicine over at permanente

00:09:21.149 --> 00:09:23.617
because of the injury, now, I
would tliek xwet to the lao

00:09:27.655 --> 00:09:29.825
family, why are we giving
them a million dollars, I'm
located in front of the lao

00:09:29.825 --> 00:09:31.825
family building and I am

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:34.860
going to start a protest

00:09:35.596 --> 00:09:37.596
today, it is so unfair that

00:09:38.166 --> 00:09:40.166
we have the lao family

00:09:40.669 --> 00:09:42.903
getting 150 million dollars
at 5 million dollars a year,

00:09:43.438 --> 00:09:45.438
that would be 150 million

00:09:46.942 --> 00:09:49.410
dollars in the 30 years
you're trying to give them

00:09:50.111 --> 00:09:52.346
this contract, if it was 10
million tlars, that would be

00:09:53.481 --> 00:09:55.481
300 million dollars, that's

00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:58.385
ridiculous to give to an
organization, any non-profit

00:09:58.753 --> 00:10:01.422
organization which has a lot
of business dealings at the
-

00:10:01.422 --> 00:10:03.857
same time they claim
themselves to be a non-profit

00:10:04.292 --> 00:10:07.610
so I'm going to be here
protesting, this is what I'm

00:10:07.529 --> 00:10:09.529
doing today, I'm over here

00:10:10.232 --> 00:10:12.232
protesting at the lao family

00:10:16.605 --> 00:10:19.306
right here on 23rd.
So, it's going to be a long

00:10:21.509 --> 00:10:24.378
fight but nobody should be in
charge of anybody for 30

00:10:25.514 --> 00:10:27.648
years, 30 years of black
homelessness are going to be

00:10:29.951 --> 00:10:32.286
given out, we're giving away
like cattle to the lao

00:10:32.654 --> 00:10:34.955
family, I'm going to be
feting here, there's all

00:10:39.928 --> 00:10:42.129
kinds of other nonprofit, all
you're going to ensure them

00:10:42.631 --> 00:10:44.631
is they have -- 

00:10:47.169 --> 00:10:49.169
>> that's the end of public

00:10:49.938 --> 00:10:52.106
comment.
>> MADAM PRESIDENT, that was

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:56.910
the last speaker.
>> thank you.

00:10:57.946 --> 00:11:00.815
I do want to give the members
of the public one final

00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:03.830
opportunity to comment on any

00:11:04.519 --> 00:11:06.519
of the four items on our

00:11:06.588 --> 00:11:09.289
agenda, so please do raise
your hand or press star 9 if

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:19.990
you wish to speak.

00:11:19.301 --> 00:11:21.936
And while we are giving the
public one last opportunity,

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:27.700
I do want to clarify the last

00:11:28.677 --> 00:11:30.677
comment, there is no pending

00:11:30.745 --> 00:11:33.547
item in terms of funding the
lao family 5 million dollars

00:11:34.849 --> 00:11:37.151
for 30 years.
They did share a request

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:40.720
which we are exploring but it

00:11:41.589 --> 00:11:44.491
is not at that amount, so, I
just want to make sure that

00:11:46.328 --> 00:11:48.328
that is clear.

00:11:48.463 --> 00:11:50.965
Okay, I do not see any new
-
hands, so MADAM Clerk, we can

00:11:52.701 --> 00:11:54.701
go op to our consent calendar.

00:11:55.770 --> 00:11:58.406

-

00:14:05.601 --> 00:14:07.601
>> thank you.

00:14:09.472 --> 00:14:10.621
Councilmember fife?
-

00:14:12.208 --> 00:14:14.576
>> yes, I want to thank
councilmember kalb for saying

00:14:14.576 --> 00:14:16.878
that, councilmember bas, and
thank you for allowing me

00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:19.980
just a few moments to share

00:14:21.517 --> 00:14:24.219
the importance of lifting up
people and their platforms

00:14:25.221 --> 00:14:27.655
who use it for more than just
what's been ascribed to them

00:14:29.625 --> 00:14:31.625
by their titles, as we know,

00:14:33.829 --> 00:14:36.231
bill russell was an amazing
phenomenal basketball player

00:14:38.267 --> 00:14:41.169
but for me while he was such
an inspiration, why he was so

00:14:42.405 --> 00:14:44.405
important to lift up is how

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:46.640
he used his platform and his

00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:49.910
voice to stand up to

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:52.680
injustice and hailing from

00:14:53.949 --> 00:14:55.949
west monroe, louisiana, the

00:14:56.319 --> 00:14:58.319
birthplace of hueyp. Newton

00:14:58.955 --> 00:15:01.522
and other revolutionary trail
blazers, I thought it was

00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:04.259
important to acknowledge that
bill russell singed his voice

00:15:04.626 --> 00:15:07.620
to stand up for civil rights
issue that is were happening

00:15:09.531 --> 00:15:12.133
when it was almost impbl for
people who looked like him to

00:15:12.902 --> 00:15:15.671
stand up to racial injustice,
so I wanted to just take a

00:15:15.671 --> 00:15:17.906
few moments to acknowledge
that and the fact he also

00:15:18.474 --> 00:15:20.474
said that going to mcclymonds

00:15:20.509 --> 00:15:22.509
was one of the best decisions

00:15:23.646 --> 00:15:26.515
he ever made and I am honored
to have been in contact with

00:15:28.518 --> 00:15:30.385
his family and to bring this
resolution forth today, I

00:15:31.554 --> 00:15:33.554
will also be doing a host of

00:15:35.525 --> 00:15:37.525
other things to acknowledge

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:40.195
this amazing oakland legend
and those things will be

00:15:40.897 --> 00:15:42.897
coming forward in my social

00:15:43.666 --> 00:15:45.666
media and in other press

00:15:45.835 --> 00:15:47.369
releases so I wanted to add
that for today.

00:15:48.204 --> 00:15:50.839
>> thank you very much,
councilmember fife, I also

00:15:52.208 --> 00:15:54.843
appreciate you honoring MR.
Russell.
Councilmember gallo?

00:15:56.846 --> 00:15:58.846
>> yes, thank you, and thank

00:15:58.914 --> 00:16:00.914

00:16:00.950 --> 00:16:02.990
bringing the celebration and
-

00:16:04.186 --> 00:16:05.654
recognition of MR. Bill
russell.

00:16:06.422 --> 00:16:08.957
He's an outstanding oakland
representative that I met

00:16:09.626 --> 00:16:11.626
many times growing up here in

00:16:11.694 --> 00:16:14.950
east oakland in the high
-
schools and certainly being

00:16:14.564 --> 00:16:16.898
involved in terms of the
sports programs that we have

00:16:18.268 --> 00:16:21.202
here in oakland and it used
to be at one time during his

00:16:23.139 --> 00:16:25.807
time that oakland had the
fifth largest professional

00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:30.110
market for recruitment of

00:16:31.348 --> 00:16:34.116
professional athletes from
basketball, baseball,

00:16:35.184 --> 00:16:37.519
football, and -- but I always
appreciated him being present

00:16:39.789 --> 00:16:42.458
at our different high schools
`
to recognize, motivate our

00:16:44.694 --> 00:16:47.563
student body, our students to
continue to pursue the

00:16:47.863 --> 00:16:50.700
university level for playing
sports as well as the

00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:52.700
professional level and

00:16:52.902 --> 00:16:54.902
certainly he opened up many

00:16:55.171 --> 00:16:57.171
doors and I just want to

00:16:59.275 --> 00:17:01.710
recognize his family and
thank if family members for

00:17:02.845 --> 00:17:05.347
the contributions not only to
mcclymonds but from

00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:08.316
castlemont to oakland tech,
fremont high school for their

00:17:08.785 --> 00:17:10.785
leadership, so thank you and

00:17:11.621 --> 00:17:14.490
it's an honor to join the
resolution to recognize MR.
Bill russell.

00:17:16.359 --> 00:17:18.359
Thank you.

00:17:18.594 --> 00:17:20.594
>> thank you, councilmember

00:17:20.796 --> 00:17:22.796

00:17:25.235 --> 00:17:27.235
for members of the the public

00:17:27.604 --> 00:17:29.604
the miralle settlement and

00:17:30.673 --> 00:17:32.673
specifically that this does

00:17:33.443 --> 00:17:35.443
provide modifications to the

00:17:35.545 --> 00:17:37.680
city's encampment management
policy including around

00:17:38.682 --> 00:17:41.283

00:18:56.326 --> 00:18:58.326
>> blair beekman.

00:19:00.296 --> 00:19:02.296
>> hi, blair beeman here,

00:19:03.467 --> 00:19:06.690
what I tried to say during
JULY public forum time,

00:19:06.302 --> 00:19:08.302
meeting times for all the

00:19:08.405 --> 00:19:10.639
many items you had during
JULY, you know, as you're

00:19:11.875 --> 00:19:13.875
dealing with bond issues and

00:19:14.110 --> 00:19:16.110
just kind of with street

00:19:16.113 --> 00:19:18.113
maintenance things and the

00:19:18.715 --> 00:19:21.217
future of local oakland
prompting, I hop this can be

00:19:24.121 --> 00:19:26.289
a commitment to really
including the surveillance

00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:28.957
technology that will be used
in projects and more

00:19:30.494 --> 00:19:33.296
importantly the importance of
the open public policies as a

00:19:36.299 --> 00:19:38.734
part of the process of how to
talk about projects.

00:19:40.871 --> 00:19:42.505
i think it will just add an
incredibly important

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:45.574
component to thousand talk
about the subject matter and

00:19:48.779 --> 00:19:51.280
it just makes it more -- the
whole process more

00:19:51.281 --> 00:19:53.281
accessible, I think people

00:19:53.284 --> 00:19:55.284
will feel a positive energy

00:19:55.486 --> 00:19:58.880
from it because it's good
stuff and a part of our lives

00:19:58.622 --> 00:20:00.622
and how you can learn to

00:20:01.425 --> 00:20:03.593
include the oakland public
policy process, I think it's

00:20:03.861 --> 00:20:05.861
important to the future of

00:20:06.596 --> 00:20:09.565
how you talk about prints in
oakland, so good luck in
those efforts.

00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:12.600
I will be mentioning this

00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:15.271
subject more and I also
wanted to offer during JULY

00:20:15.973 --> 00:20:18.675
and I didn't and luckily I
can now, I hope in this month

00:20:21.578 --> 00:20:23.578
of AUGUST, we can work on the

00:20:23.713 --> 00:20:26.116
concepts peace in the ukraine
area, there's an opening for

00:20:26.884 --> 00:20:29.819
dialogue of peace, real
negotiation of peace and that

00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:35.560
means all sides include thing

00:20:36.761 --> 00:20:38.761
U.S., including these weird

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:41.530
accents with ewe with nuclear
power, to gather together and

00:20:42.466 --> 00:20:45.435
put their best foot forward
in what we know what to do

00:20:45.869 --> 00:20:47.869
and those ideas of peace and

00:20:47.939 --> 00:20:50.740
those can be based on the
good practices we do here

00:20:51.808 --> 00:20:54.310
locally of racial equity and
health and human

00:20:54.811 --> 00:20:57.214
services,less bring that to
the community level in

00:20:57.414 --> 00:20:58.982
ukraine and work for peace
now, thank you.

00:21:01.151 --> 00:21:03.151
>> thank you, MS. Olugbala?

00:21:04.789 --> 00:21:07.624
>> thank you, MADAM Chair, I
appreciate you so much, I

00:21:08.159 --> 00:21:10.159
want to bring a couple of

00:21:11.462 --> 00:21:13.462
things to your attention.

00:21:15.132 --> 00:21:17.132
On AUGUST 2, a member of the

00:21:17.701 --> 00:21:19.701
california supreme court

00:21:21.338 --> 00:21:23.472
revoked san francisco
non-citizens' ability to vote

00:21:24.408 --> 00:21:26.408
in school board elections.

00:21:27.344 --> 00:21:29.344
Based on the fact that it

00:21:29.413 --> 00:21:31.347
violated the california
constitution that said you

00:21:32.516 --> 00:21:34.516
had to be a citizen in order

00:21:35.286 --> 00:21:38.200
to participate in the voting
process.
Your measure that you're

00:21:39.524 --> 00:21:41.524
getting ready to put on the

00:21:41.592 --> 00:21:43.592
ballot that allows

00:21:44.161 --> 00:21:47.290
non-citizens to vote in
school board elections with

00:21:50.802 --> 00:21:53.369
the caveat at some point that
would be non-citizens who are

00:21:54.105 --> 00:21:56.640
parents and at some point,
any resident who is a

00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:58.640
non-citizen can vote.

00:21:58.976 --> 00:22:00.976
You need to rethink that

00:22:01.450 --> 00:22:03.450
because at this point, it has

00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:05.470
been revoked in san francisco.

00:22:05.683 --> 00:22:07.683
At the same time, you put

00:22:07.751 --> 00:22:09.751
non-citizens at risk because

00:22:10.221 --> 00:22:12.356
the information they have to
-
provide to register can be

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:18.161
shared with the department of
justice.
Another situation that came

00:22:20.431 --> 00:22:22.431
up this week recently is that

00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:24.668
the voter of registrars for
alameda county is not going

00:22:27.805 --> 00:22:29.805
to be able to create a

00:22:30.274 --> 00:22:32.442
process for 16 and 17
-
year-oldses under measure qq

00:22:34.913 --> 00:22:36.913
to be able to vote.

00:22:38.782 --> 00:22:41.684
I have asked you, have you
contacted the voter of

00:22:42.754 --> 00:22:44.754
registrars of alameda county

00:22:45.323 --> 00:22:47.323
to confirm that that

00:22:47.425 --> 00:22:49.425
individual or that the county

00:22:50.461 --> 00:22:52.461
will be able develop an

00:22:52.897 --> 00:22:55.320
application for the measure
for non-citizen voting.

00:22:55.299 --> 00:22:57.834
You act like you can go ahead
and do that without that

00:22:58.936 --> 00:23:01.204
being in place but you need
to confirm that and that

00:23:03.541 --> 00:23:06.342
measure needs to be taken off
the ballot in -- &

00:23:07.779 --> 00:23:09.779
!>> I do apologize, MS.

00:23:10.782 --> 00:23:13.583
Olugbala, your to minutes
have ended, those are the

00:23:14.685 --> 00:23:17.288
only two speakers who wish to
speak.
We do have one hand this's

00:23:17.288 --> 00:23:19.589
gone up.
>> okay, let's take that

00:23:19.624 --> 00:23:21.624
hand, please.

00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:24.360
>> phone number ending in

00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:30.660
9932, please press star 6.

00:23:30.602 --> 00:23:33.269
>> nino parker, black
-
homeless advocate, I'm here

00:23:34.138 --> 00:23:36.138
protesting in front of the

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:39.342
lao family, one of the things
I really would like to see

00:23:40.511 --> 00:23:42.511
this council look into is

00:23:43.381 --> 00:23:45.381
putting together a non-profit

00:23:45.416 --> 00:23:48.118
fraud unit, there's a lot of
non-profits here getting big

00:23:48.753 --> 00:23:51.422
bundles of money that aren't
using it to help people.

00:23:51.655 --> 00:23:53.655
One of the things I would

00:23:53.991 --> 00:23:55.991
like the know is when you're

00:23:56.128 --> 00:23:58.262
giving a contract a lao
family like four million

00:23:58.697 --> 00:24:01.431
dollars which you were
supposed to clean up 12th

00:24:01.432 --> 00:24:03.432
street which you didn't do

00:24:04.402 --> 00:24:07.337
which is causing some break
ins, also I'm at the lao

00:24:07.872 --> 00:24:10.507
family, I came here yesterday
to ask how to get into the

00:24:10.775 --> 00:24:12.775
housing program and it says I

00:24:12.777 --> 00:24:14.777
have to live on 12th street

00:24:17.615 --> 00:24:19.316
or I couldn't goeltet in it,
so the care center is the

00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:22.719
only people on 12th street,
mostly asians, so I'm

00:24:24.156 --> 00:24:26.156
wondering now, I call it the

00:24:26.691 --> 00:24:29.920
race card every time I see
it, don't be mad because you

00:24:31.763 --> 00:24:33.965
MAY be it, there's something
wrong with giving great

00:24:33.965 --> 00:24:35.965
swaths of money to other

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:38.936
people and other agencies.
Like I said, if they xwot

00:24:41.539 --> 00:24:44.740
that 5 million contract you
were talking about, that

00:24:45.576 --> 00:24:47.478
would be 300 million dollars
anybody working there would

00:24:48.179 --> 00:24:50.814
be set for 30 years, we need
to have some type of fraud

00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:54.985
unit for non-profits here in
oakland.
And here's an organize fiez

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:57.720
sighing that I believe is a

00:24:57.989 --> 00:25:00.791
housing or they have like
business organization on the

00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:04.528
one side and the other side
is non-profit, ther's a lot

00:25:04.963 --> 00:25:06.963
of bad stuff going on with

00:25:07.499 --> 00:25:09.499
the lao family e specially

00:25:10.402 --> 00:25:12.402
when they house blacks in

00:25:12.837 --> 00:25:15.405
rich chord when they house
their own people in here in

00:25:16.542 --> 00:25:18.542
town, I haven't seen one

00:25:18.610 --> 00:25:20.610
black employee go in there, I

00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:23.714
was here at 8:00, I've seen
some asian employees, where

00:25:28.353 --> 00:25:30.320
are the black employees they
claim to have, -- 

00:25:30.788 --> 00:25:32.788
>> thank you for your

00:25:32.991 --> 00:25:34.692

speaker.

00:25:35.861 --> 00:25:37.861
>> thank you to everyone for
