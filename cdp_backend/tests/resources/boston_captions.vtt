We're going to move to motions,

00:19:09.215 --> 00:19:11.183
order and resolutions of thank
you councilor fired for years.

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:15.721
Thank you, MR. CHAIRMAN.
You see my light they just had

00:19:15.721 --> 00:19:17.721
a question through the chair to

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:19.691
the maker or to the chair and I
do not get in conflict.

00:19:21.528 --> 00:19:23.495
It precluded from attending the
hearing.
But when we strengthen the

00:19:24.864 --> 00:19:27.367
resident to claim several years
ago we did get a commitment
from the boston public health

00:19:27.367 --> 00:19:29.436
commission that they would
adhere to that.

00:19:29.436 --> 00:19:31.436
And I just noticed that we've

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:34.807
got an address of framingham
and we've got an address
of brooklyn and I know we've

00:19:35.975 --> 00:19:38.478
got some of the brightest minds
right here in boston and I
don't see framingham or

00:19:38.478 --> 00:19:40.478
brooklyn stepping up to the

00:19:40.847 --> 00:19:42.847
plate to help us siting detox

00:19:43.317 --> 00:19:45.419
facilities and halfway houses
and recovery homes.
So I just threw the chair to

00:19:45.419 --> 00:19:47.419
the maker.

00:19:47.654 --> 00:19:49.521
I want to know whether or not
they had any response to that

00:19:51.424 --> 00:19:53.292
unless it's a specific seat
designed to go to a specific

00:19:55.161 --> 00:19:57.197
person say an executive
director of a community health
center.

00:19:57.197 --> 00:19:59.332
But I'd just like to sort
of get that on the record and

00:19:59.332 --> 00:20:01.734
let the boston public health
commission know that they
committed to this body several

00:20:04.773 --> 00:20:07.340
years ago during during the
period of time when we
strengthened the residency
requirement that that it would

00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:09.340
be sending us their

00:20:10.176 --> 00:20:12.312
representatives would be from
from the neighborhoods
of boston.
Thank you.

00:20:12.312 --> 00:20:14.546
Thank you.
Councilor finerty.

00:20:14.648 --> 00:20:15.881
Councilor murphy, the floor is
yours.

00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:20.352
So I did check with that and we
asked them both because they
weren't hiding that they live

00:20:22.455 --> 00:20:24.323
in brookline in framingham and
I was told that the enabling

00:20:25.492 --> 00:20:27.960
access lives or works in and
they both work closely in the
city of boston.

00:20:30.363 --> 00:20:32.363
But to recall we can check to

00:20:36.569 --> 00:20:38.569
see if to changes at this point

00:20:39.873 --> 00:20:41.840
I would make is this commission
remind them that they made a

00:20:43.810 --> 00:20:45.577
commitment to his body that
they would obviously make best

00:20:47.948 --> 00:20:50.683
efforts to when their drawing
boards and commissions that the
residents of the city of boston

00:20:51.385 --> 00:20:53.385
so I know they know that they

00:20:54.454 --> 00:20:57.220
have folks that work for the
public health mission that are
from the neighborhoods

00:20:58.458 --> 00:21:00.660
of boston that would be most
suitable obviously to serve in
that capacity.

00:21:02.162 --> 00:21:04.630
So willing to I guess withdraw
the inquiry to not block this

00:21:06.332 --> 00:21:08.133
but they need to know loud and
clear that the boston city

00:21:09.704 --> 00:21:12.605
council expects them to honor
their word as it pertains to
the residents requirement in
the city.

00:21:13.906 --> 00:21:15.808

record reflect that the chair
is PRESIDENT.

00:26:00.127 --> 00:26:02.127

electronic application and
transmission of absentee

00:26:16.577 --> 00:26:18.577
ballots or absent uniformed

00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:21.715
services voters.
Thank you, MR. Clark.
The chair recognizes

00:26:21.715 --> 00:26:23.883
councilor murphy.
COUNCILMAN, if you have the
floor.

00:26:25.519 --> 00:26:27.620
Thank you, councilor.
So I along with PRESIDENT Flynn

00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:31.891
here with for your approval
of home rule petition to the

00:26:33.661 --> 00:26:35.328
general court entitled a
petition for a special law

00:26:37.398 --> 00:26:39.799
regarding an act relative to
the authorization of an
electronic absentee ballot

00:26:42.570 --> 00:26:44.304
application in electronic
transmission of ballots for

00:26:45.673 --> 00:26:47.674
absent uniform service voters.
Massachusetts citizens have a

00:26:50.177 --> 00:26:52.450
right to vote in all elections
even if deployed or stationed

00:26:53.414 --> 00:26:55.215
overseas.
The uniformed and overseas

00:26:57.585 --> 00:26:59.452
citizens absentee voting act is
a federal law that guarantees

00:27:01.255 --> 00:27:03.223
voting rights for the united
states military who are known

00:27:05.493 --> 00:27:07.428
as uniformed service voters by
the federal laws definition

00:27:09.397 --> 00:27:11.264
eligible uniformed service
voters strictly include those

00:27:13.868 --> 00:27:15.868
on active duty in the army,

00:27:16.604 --> 00:27:19.139
navy, air force, marine corps,
coast guard including
reservists, space force in the

00:27:21.943 --> 00:27:23.943
merchant marine members as well

00:27:24.412 --> 00:27:26.179
as their spouses independence
more specifically absent

00:27:28.749 --> 00:27:30.617
uniformed services voters are
located outside of their voting

00:27:33.587 --> 00:27:35.355
district in massata suits
absent uniformed service voters

00:27:37.525 --> 00:27:39.392
are exempt from voter registry
requirements but instead must

00:27:41.495 --> 00:27:43.230
mail an absentee ballot
application to their local

00:27:45.833 --> 00:27:47.601
election office in order to
obtain their ballot for

00:27:48.936 --> 00:27:51.471
municipal elections in
massachusetts, a blank ballot
will only be delivered through

00:27:53.341 --> 00:27:55.341
the mail in must also be

00:27:56.844 --> 00:27:58.745
returned through the mail.
However, for federal elections

00:28:00.682 --> 00:28:03.483
a ballot can be emailed faxed
or mailed based on preference
in the voted ballot MAY be

00:28:05.286 --> 00:28:07.286
mailed back or electronically

00:28:08.890 --> 00:28:11.691
returned through email or fax.
This is a more modern approach
for absentee uniformed services

00:28:13.261 --> 00:28:14.528
voters to participate in
elections.

00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:19.165
Mail in ballots have already
caused problems in some
elections nationwide.

00:28:21.369 --> 00:28:22.969
We know in wisconsin 9000
requested ballots were never

00:28:24.905 --> 00:28:26.673
sent and thousands were
postmarked too late to count.

00:28:28.709 --> 00:28:31.411
In new jersey, nine point six
of mail ballots cast in the
state's local elections were

00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:34.181
rejected because signatures
didn't match the ones on file

00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:38.518
or arrived too late.
And in pennsylvania tens
of thousands of votes were

00:28:40.388 --> 00:28:41.922
either not cast or are not
counted due to deadline

00:28:43.691 --> 00:28:45.559
confusion through this
electronic application for an

00:28:47.828 --> 00:28:50.364
absentee ballot for municipal
elections will streamline the
absentee ballot application

00:28:52.466 --> 00:28:54.101
process by eliminating the
shipping time required to

00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:57.905
receive and deliver an
application also through this

00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:01.742
act electronically delivering
and returning the ballots

00:29:03.144 --> 00:29:05.645
itself through email or fax
will help better guarantee
voting rights for absent

00:29:08.549 --> 00:29:10.500
uniformed services voters by
streamlining the voting

00:29:12.353 --> 00:29:14.221
process, ensuring each ballot
is counted in reducing the

00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:18.190
number of rejected ballot.

00:29:20.161 --> 00:29:22.280
So in short I urge my fellow
colleagues in this body to

00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:26.566
support this special act so
that we can better help
guarantee voting rights for

00:29:28.336 --> 00:29:30.300
absent uniform service voters
in accordance with the

00:29:32.730 --> 00:29:34.740
uniformed and overseas citizens
absentee voting act as well as

00:29:36.244 --> 00:29:37.978
modernize the voting process
for invisible elections like

00:29:40.248 --> 00:29:42.282
they do in elections federal
elections.
So thank you.

00:29:43.318 --> 00:29:45.319
Thank you councilor murphy.
The chair now recognizes

00:29:47.422 --> 00:29:49.556
council PRESIDENT Flynn.
Thank you, council arroyo and I

00:29:51.225 --> 00:29:53.930
want to say thank you to
councilor murphy for taking the

00:29:55.196 --> 00:29:57.196
lead on this important this

00:29:58.366 --> 00:30:00.601
important piece of policy
change that we're going to make

00:30:02.370 --> 00:30:04.404
here.
And I know I have talked with

00:30:06.107 --> 00:30:08.809
the mayor's team and with the
election department and they've
always been strong supporters

00:30:10.979 --> 00:30:12.979
of voting for veterans and for

00:30:14.349 --> 00:30:15.882
military families veterans
overseas especially.

00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:20.887
So I'm looking forward to the
next step in making sure that

00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:24.560
all active duty or reserve

00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:27.660
reservist serving overseas have

00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:30.764
the opportunity to vote in
elections.

00:30:32.667 --> 00:30:34.000
It's a critical part of our
democracy.

00:30:36.571 --> 00:30:38.639
Just as an example I was I was
in a small country in bahrain

00:30:41.442 --> 00:30:43.610
in the persian gulf requesting
the absentee ballot and the day

00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:47.280
my ballot was supposed to

00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:50.884
arrive to me I I was flown to
another country and what that

00:30:52.954 --> 00:30:54.621
ballot never reached me and it
could reach me vote several

00:30:56.591 --> 00:30:58.492
months later after voting.
But for military people it's

00:31:00.895 --> 00:31:02.763
not as simple as just just
getting a piece of mail

00:31:04.632 --> 00:31:07.401
delivered to you to your home,
to you, to your office.
It's very challenging when

00:31:08.770 --> 00:31:11.500
you're overseas.
But again I want to say thank

00:31:12.707 --> 00:31:14.641
you to councilor murphy and to
all of my colleagues who have

00:31:16.444 --> 00:31:18.312
who have advocated for veterans
in military families whether

00:31:20.582 --> 00:31:22.916
they were on the council or
prior to the job on the
council.

00:31:24.719 --> 00:31:26.453
But I know you've always and
strong supporters of military

00:31:28.256 --> 00:31:30.124
families so I just want to say
thank you for all of the city

00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:34.429
workers that do tremendous work
and help in helping our
veterans.
Thank you, councilor.

00:31:34.429 --> 00:31:36.429
Thank you.

00:31:36.431 --> 00:31:38.198
Council PRESIDENT Flynn, would
anyone else like to speak on

00:31:39.968 --> 00:31:42.336

to historic and
disproportionate state
disinvestment in the city

00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:23.900
of boston.

00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:27.881
The chair recognizes
councilor brighton
council PRESIDENT You have the

00:32:39.194 --> 00:32:41.194
full which my notes.

00:32:44.132 --> 00:32:46.132
Thank you mr PRESIDENT.

00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:49.637
I want to extend my
appreciation to consider the

00:32:51.606 --> 00:32:53.507
region's willingness to lead on
this issue with me despite her

00:32:55.443 --> 00:32:57.443
absence today through this

00:32:59.447 --> 00:33:01.348
year's budget process we dug
deeper into to get a better

00:33:03.318 --> 00:33:05.152
understanding not just the
figures and numbers from each

00:33:07.122 --> 00:33:08.856
individual department but the
office of budget management's

00:33:10.425 --> 00:33:12.193
narrative analyzing trends in
the city's fiscal condition

00:33:15.263 --> 00:33:17.531
over the span of several years
.
A couple of weeks ago I

00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:21.168
followed orders related to city
personnel and the state of the

00:33:22.370 --> 00:33:24.105
public sector workforce after
reviewing twenty years

00:33:26.740 --> 00:33:28.800
of staffing level data
revealing some striking trends

00:33:30.912 --> 00:33:33.447
only looking at the current
year and the past couple
of years didn't show the

00:33:34.616 --> 00:33:37.418
historic trends.
The same is the case for
boston's relationship with the

00:33:38.353 --> 00:33:40.355
state.
We have to look at the long

00:33:40.355 --> 00:33:42.355
view to understand the big

00:33:42.524 --> 00:33:44.458
picture.
Over the past twenty years the

00:33:46.828 --> 00:33:48.729
city's net revenue in state aid
has been reduced by over 300

00:33:50.999 --> 00:33:52.999
million per year or a 70

00:33:53.969 --> 00:33:55.969
percent reduction in our state

00:33:57.272 --> 00:33:59.974
aid has been dropping but what
year over year our state
assessments for charter school

00:34:02.144 --> 00:34:04.144
tuition and the mbt climb

00:34:04.713 --> 00:34:06.747
exponentially.
The result is in our budget

00:34:08.717 --> 00:34:10.585
year after year is increased
reliance on property taxes for

00:34:12.955 --> 00:34:14.922
our revenues source twenty
years ago the property tax

00:34:17.292 --> 00:34:18.626
accounted for 55 percent of our
revenue.

00:34:20.663 --> 00:34:22.730
Now 20 years later it's
expected to reach 75 percent

00:34:24.700 --> 00:34:26.400
of our revenue.
This relationship is

00:34:27.869 --> 00:34:29.303
unsustainable for the city and
our residents.

00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:33.841
In 2006, mayor menino
commissioned the borough
research department to conduct

00:34:36.245 --> 00:34:38.413
a report called boston gives
more than it gets from the rest

00:34:39.881 --> 00:34:41.849
of massachusetts.
It found that we generate more

00:34:43.619 --> 00:34:45.553
than our fair share of stich
instead jobs, state tax

00:34:47.823 --> 00:34:49.590
revenue, state income,
corporate excise and business

00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:53.728
tax revenue, visiter revenue
and state ortel tax revenue.

00:34:56.298 --> 00:34:58.533
But we do not get a fair share.
It was a problem then and it is

00:34:59.101 --> 00:35:01.135
a problem.
We have an opportunity to forge

00:35:03.739 --> 00:35:06.400
transformative partnerships
with our colleagues at the
state level.

00:35:07.876 --> 00:35:10.244
We have a mayor and city
council whose policies at times
require state approval that

00:35:12.810 --> 00:35:14.140
move at a glacial pace.
We know what home rule

00:35:15.384 --> 00:35:17.510
petitions take forever like the
zba reforms reform bill

00:35:19.455 --> 00:35:21.389
submitted in 229 which is still
hasn't moved anywhere if the

00:35:23.692 --> 00:35:25.426
state is going to pursue
targeted scrutiny and oversight

00:35:27.429 --> 00:35:29.197
of the city of boston, we
should we should assess what is

00:35:31.990 --> 00:35:32.968
and isn't working from the
current relationship for the

00:35:35.137 --> 00:35:37.905
interests of the city.
looking ahead, I believe we
need a more proactive

00:35:39.608 --> 00:35:41.175
collaboration with the boston
delegation members including

00:35:42.711 --> 00:35:44.479
those in leadership roles such
as the leaders from my district

00:35:46.282 --> 00:35:48.583
and those chairing committees
like ways and means at the
state house.

00:35:50.619 --> 00:35:52.286
We also are looking at the
possibility of a governor from

00:35:54.690 --> 00:35:56.758
the city sitting in the corner
office in less than a year from

00:35:58.728 --> 00:36:00.928
now is the council, the
mayor's administration and
members of the boston

00:36:02.698 --> 00:36:04.365
delegation and should be
strategizing a game plan for

00:36:06.235 --> 00:36:08.200
the city to achieve real
tangible results and receive

00:36:10.973 --> 00:36:12.973
its fair share to to right the

00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:15.843
wrongs that been done to us
over the past several decades

00:36:17.813 --> 00:36:20.548
and that is what this hearing
is about.
Thank you.
Thank you, mr PRESIDENT.

00:36:21.850 --> 00:36:23.785
Thank you.

four councilor he offered the
following order for a hearing

00:37:02.692 --> 00:37:04.225
on accountability and
accessibility of language

00:37:06.395 --> 00:37:08.630
access services in the city
of austin.
Thank you mr clark.

00:37:10.667 --> 00:37:12.200
The chair now recognizes
councilor I'm here.

00:37:14.770 --> 00:37:17.705
Thank you mr vice PRESIDENT And
thank you mr PRESIDENT And I
like to suspend the rules

00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:21.740
allowed you both councilor and

00:37:21.544 --> 00:37:23.544
councilor flynn as original

00:37:25.949 --> 00:37:27.348
co-sponsors of seeing no
objection there.

00:37:28.918 --> 00:37:30.585
So we're following this in
order for two reasons.

00:37:32.721 --> 00:37:35.223
The first is that in twenty
twenty one the boston city
council passed an ordinance

00:37:36.892 --> 00:37:38.793
amending the city language
access policies in order to

00:37:41.163 --> 00:37:43.163
give a newly qualified office

00:37:44.633 --> 00:37:46.601
of language and communications
access the time they needed to

00:37:55.711 --> 00:37:58.800
fully implement the new laws.
It was decided that the
effective date for the

00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:00.483
ordinance will be set a year in
advance.
We're now approaching that 12
month deadline and it's

00:38:00.483 --> 00:38:03.452
important that we get a better
understanding of where we are
and regards to the
implementation of the
ordinance.

00:38:03.719 --> 00:38:05.820
The second reason we're filing
here order has to do with the

00:38:07.890 --> 00:38:09.557
new line item four in-house
translators and interpreters

00:38:11.627 --> 00:38:13.361
having spoken with a few with a
number of translators and

00:38:15.631 --> 00:38:17.265
interpreters, we have come to
understand just how specialized

00:38:19.501 --> 00:38:21.302
a field it really is and how
important it is to make a

00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:24.839
distinction between someone who
is bilingual and someone who

00:38:26.742 --> 00:38:28.977
has the capacity to serve as
interpreter.
We also need to better

00:38:30.980 --> 00:38:32.614
understand how translators and
interpreters are currently

00:38:34.818 --> 00:38:37.850
contracted and what metrics we
use to determine their quality
of service.

00:38:39.550 --> 00:38:41.122
It probably goes without saying
but it's very difficult to to

00:38:42.591 --> 00:38:44.560
ask a on english speaking
person to rate the quality

00:38:46.428 --> 00:38:48.430
of interpretation when they
have no insight into the source

00:38:50.165 --> 00:38:52.100
material.
So we need to understand more

00:38:52.902 --> 00:38:54.969
about what we can do to ensure
we have the best people working

00:38:57.139 --> 00:39:00.750
as interpreters because that
says a lot about how we value
our non english speaking

00:39:01.243 --> 00:39:03.912
community.
I'm looking forward to this
hearing and to working

00:39:05.615 --> 00:39:07.582
alongside councilor flynn and
royals who have both been

00:39:09.552 --> 00:39:11.486
champions of immigrants and in
language access.
Thank you.

00:39:13.322 --> 00:39:15.223
Thank you councilor mejia.
The chair now recognizes

00:39:17.326 --> 00:39:19.527
council PRESIDENT Flynn.
Thank you council of royal and

00:39:21.897 --> 00:39:23.897
thank you consulate here for

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.735
adding me and for working for
important work that you've done
on language and communication

00:39:28.471 --> 00:39:30.672
access.
It's a critical issue facing
our city.

00:39:32.908 --> 00:39:34.908
It's important that we have

00:39:36.679 --> 00:39:38.346
city services in various
languages so that residents

00:39:40.716 --> 00:39:42.551
across boston MAY not speak
english, have the opportunity

00:39:43.820 --> 00:39:45.820
to engage city government in

00:39:48.324 --> 00:39:49.991
acquiring these city services,
especially following during

00:39:51.527 --> 00:39:53.495
this pandemic where services
are needed for our children

00:39:55.665 --> 00:39:56.998
especially mental health
counseling.

00:39:59.368 --> 00:40:01.870
But we need to make sure that
our residents are able to
communicate with city officials

00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:05.840
in many languages such as

00:40:07.543 --> 00:40:09.278
cantonese such as mandarin,
spanish, various other

00:40:12.810 --> 00:40:14.810
languages that many, many speak

00:40:14.650 --> 00:40:16.650
across vietnamese across across

00:40:18.655 --> 00:40:20.588
the city haitian creole so I
just want to thank my

00:40:22.492 --> 00:40:25.193
colleagues councilor mejia,
councilor and all of my city
council colleagues for the

00:40:27.630 --> 00:40:28.830
important work on language and
communication access along with

00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:33.400
mayor was was a city

00:40:33.970 --> 00:40:36.371
councilor also was a strong
supporter of language and
communication abilities as
well.

00:40:48.618 --> 00:40:50.618
Thank thank you councilor.

00:40:52.555 --> 00:40:54.189
The chair recognizes
councilor thank you

00:40:56.726 --> 00:40:59.462
council PRESIDENT Flynn and I
just want to note behind the
scenes I'm sure folks who are

00:41:00.730 --> 00:41:02.898
watching this can hear the
music going on in the
background.

00:41:04.167 --> 00:41:05.801
That's a celebration of our
asian-american and pacific

00:41:08.204 --> 00:41:10.605
islander community and I think
it's sort of indicative of what
language access is about.

00:41:12.141 --> 00:41:13.909
It's about making this city
government more accessible to

00:41:16.279 --> 00:41:18.347
folks and making sure that
folks have a way of being heard

00:41:20.450 --> 00:41:22.170
in the chambers that are making
decisions on their lives.

00:41:24.153 --> 00:41:26.880
And so I look forward to this.
I really appreciate councilor,

00:41:27.123 --> 00:41:28.891
his tireless efforts on behalf
of folks who speak languages

00:41:31.610 --> 00:41:33.610
other than english and for

00:41:34.964 --> 00:41:37.330
councilor flynn's steadfast,
accomplished accomplished
status and making sure that we

00:41:37.330 --> 00:41:40.200
are working towards these
things.

00:41:40.136 --> 00:41:41.870
And so I look forward to a
hearing because it's vitally

00:41:43.539 --> 00:41:45.340
important to all of us that
when we are speaking and

00:41:47.410 --> 00:41:49.978
issuing city ordinances or home
rule petitions or things that
impact people's lives that they

00:41:51.547 --> 00:41:53.115
know and understand and can
participate and partake in

00:41:54.784 --> 00:41:57.319
those discussions and really
understand how this government,
our municipal government is

00:41:58.388 --> 00:42:00.623
impacting their lives in ways
in which we can make it better.
So thank you,

00:42:00.623 --> 00:42:02.424
council PRESIDENT.
Thank you, COUNCILMAN.

00:42:02.925 --> 00:42:04.493

also been steadfast in making
this happens.
Thank you, councilor.

00:42:10.366 --> 00:42:12.366
Would anyone else like to speak

00:42:13.136 --> 00:42:15.136
on this matter?

00:42:17.808 --> 00:42:19.809

resolution urging the
massachusetts legislature to

00:43:03.853 --> 00:43:05.554
oppose house one two three four
and the proposed twenty twenty

00:43:09.525 --> 00:43:11.360
two state ballot initiative.
Thank you mr clark.

00:43:13.696 --> 00:43:15.699
The chair recognizes
council alara council are you
of the floor?

00:43:15.699 --> 00:43:17.699
Thank you PRESIDENT Flynn.

00:43:18.100 --> 00:43:19.868
i would to suspend the rules
and that councilor arroyo as

00:43:21.571 --> 00:43:23.439
one of the original co-sponsors
councilor arroyo was so so

00:43:24.708 --> 00:43:27.543
added as an original co-sponsor
councilor you of the floor.
Thank you so much PRESIDENT

00:43:28.511 --> 00:43:30.511
Flynn.

00:43:32.349 --> 00:43:34.216
Today we had a couple of dozen
app based drivers and workers

00:43:35.785 --> 00:43:37.553
downstairs with us and elected
officials, city councilors and

00:43:39.422 --> 00:43:41.290
labor leaders from all across
the state coming together in

00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:45.527
support for this resolution app
based companies such as uber,

00:43:47.697 --> 00:43:49.465
lyft and jordache are proposing
a deceptive ballot question

00:43:51.468 --> 00:43:53.102
that's going to deny employees
vital workplace protections

00:43:56.500 --> 00:43:57.540
such as minimum wage, equal pay
paid leave, retirement,

00:43:58.708 --> 00:44:01.210
workplace safeguards against
sexual and racial harassment,
unemployment and workers

00:44:02.779 --> 00:44:05.247
compensation.
Essentially they're denying all
hope of a workplace where

00:44:06.816 --> 00:44:09.485
people feel respected,
protected and well paid.
Undeniably we've seen that

00:44:11.154 --> 00:44:13.689
technology has given workers
more flexibility through the
gig economy but the price that

00:44:15.258 --> 00:44:17.393
working people in boston are
paying for those flexible hours
is incredibly steep.

00:44:19.530 --> 00:44:21.297
We are currently in a pivotal
moment where the future of work

00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:24.900
as digital tycoons are building
empires on the backs

00:44:26.903 --> 00:44:28.637
of underpaid workers who are
facing escalating housing, food

00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:32.641
and fuel costs daily during a
pandemic, women accounted for
more than 60 percent of the

00:44:34.211 --> 00:44:36.178
nation's two point one million
job losses and as a result many

00:44:37.948 --> 00:44:40.382
of our friends and families
turn to the gig economy in
record numbers, especially

00:44:40.918 --> 00:44:43.786
women of color.
At uber, women drivers
increased by 80 percent in the

00:44:45.555 --> 00:44:47.189
last year at inbreeds, the
number of women delivery

00:44:49.392 --> 00:44:51.126
drivers doubled from APRIL
twenty twenty to JANUARY twenty

00:44:53.290 --> 00:44:55.765
twenty two and add to cart over
70 percent of the company's six
hundred thousand drivers are

00:44:57.100 --> 00:44:59.802
women.
So when app based companies
like uber lived in dash propose

00:45:01.171 --> 00:45:02.972
a deceptive ballot question
that would deny employees vital

00:45:03.940 --> 00:45:06.742
workplace protections, we take
as a direct attack on working
women especially women of color

00:45:08.311 --> 00:45:11.180
and especially immigrants.
Many of our friends and loved
ones have turned to these jobs

00:45:13.349 --> 00:45:15.251
out of necessity to care for
their own families and to earn

00:45:16.219 --> 00:45:18.954
extra cash and it's been all
of our benefit app based
services help us get dinner on

00:45:20.857 --> 00:45:22.425
the table, travel home from the
doctor's office and have

00:45:24.270 --> 00:45:26.629
groceries delivered at the end
the day they provide ease and
convenience particularly for

00:45:28.598 --> 00:45:30.399
working class people, the
elderly and disabled who have

00:45:32.535 --> 00:45:35.400
who heavily rely on these
services.
They're an asset but this asset

00:45:35.872 --> 00:45:37.573
is made possible exclusively by
the workers whose rights are

00:45:39.242 --> 00:45:40.876
going to be put at risk by
proposition twenty two.

00:45:43.460 --> 00:45:45.581
The statewide measure is being
bankrolled by app based
companies and it's an attempted

00:45:47.784 --> 00:45:50.850
end run around labor law that
would create a permanent
underclass of underpaid workers

00:45:51.555 --> 00:45:53.322
of all ages in every community
but especially in black brown

00:45:55.292 --> 00:45:57.994
immigrant communities.
big tech has already spent two
hundred and twenty four million

00:45:58.763 --> 00:46:00.429
on proposition twenty two in
california in a successful

00:46:02.990 --> 00:46:04.533
attempt to exclude ridesharing
based workers from workplace
protections that are afforded

00:46:06.504 --> 00:46:09.500
to them under the law and they
plan on spending another one
hundred million here in

00:46:10.907 --> 00:46:13.342
massachusetts if house bill
twelve twenty four passed is
going to create a permanent

00:46:14.511 --> 00:46:16.379
underclass of low mostly black,
brown and immigrant workers by

00:46:18.148 --> 00:46:21.830
allowing these companies to pay
their workers less than minimum
wage and provide few if any

00:46:22.152 --> 00:46:23.819
benefits the numbers that we're
currently looking at range from

00:46:25.489 --> 00:46:27.490
four dollars and eighty two
cents an hour to six dollars

00:46:29.593 --> 00:46:31.828
and thirty five cents an hour.
I'm filing this resolution
because I believe that the

00:46:31.828 --> 00:46:34.331
boston city council has a
responsibility to prioritize

00:46:34.331 --> 00:46:36.331
workers over corporate profits

00:46:37.601 --> 00:46:40.336
to protect our consumers and
oppose any measure that's going
to facilitate wage theft and

00:46:42.105 --> 00:46:44.674
undermine the rights and
benefits of the working class
people who keep our city
running.

00:46:46.900 --> 00:46:48.511
I'm requesting that we suspend
the rules and move for a
passage of this resolution

00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:51.614
today.
Thank you, council alara.

00:46:52.716 --> 00:46:54.818
The chair recognizes
council arroyo council arroyo,
you have the floor.

00:46:54.818 --> 00:46:56.818
Thank you.

00:46:56.820 --> 00:46:58.955
Council PRESIDENT Flynn and
thank you, councilor, for your

00:47:00.924 --> 00:47:02.492
leadership here to twenty
twenty two state ballot

00:47:04.462 --> 00:47:06.963
referendum is essentially
asking mass legislators and
voters to grant special

00:47:09.133 --> 00:47:11.667
exemptions from our labor,
civil rights and consumer
protection laws that are anti

00:47:13.437 --> 00:47:15.437
worker that are anti the rights

00:47:16.607 --> 00:47:18.575
of our massachusetts residents
who are working in these places

00:47:20.878 --> 00:47:22.879
in these gig economy.
Uber lived in the different

00:47:23.847 --> 00:47:25.982
ones that that are partaking.
We know that people depend on

00:47:27.785 --> 00:47:29.718
this work.
We know that the current

00:47:31.588 --> 00:47:33.657
advertising campaign frankly to
call it what it is is calling

00:47:35.625 --> 00:47:38.595
into question that the idea
that if we give folks these
rights, if we give folks the

00:47:39.290 --> 00:47:41.598
dignity that they respect those
workers that they should get as
workers and the respect they

00:47:44.401 --> 00:47:47.304
deserve as workers, that we are
harming them by removing their
flexibility.
And I just want to be clear

00:47:47.304 --> 00:47:49.380
that nothing prevents any
of these places from offering

00:47:50.741 --> 00:47:53.409
flexible schedules or flexible
working hours.
They are fully able to do that

00:47:55.279 --> 00:47:57.880
and to continue to provide that
flexibility to their workers.
The only thing this does is

00:47:59.249 --> 00:48:01.584
ensure that they're paying into
social security, that they're
paying into unemployment, that

00:48:03.354 --> 00:48:05.421
they're providing civil rights
protections and sexual
harassment protections, that

00:48:06.957 --> 00:48:09.158
they are treating their workers
with respect and dignity that
they deserve.

00:48:09.293 --> 00:48:11.395
And so I'm in full throated
support for this.

00:48:11.395 --> 00:48:13.395
It is incredibly important that

00:48:14.231 --> 00:48:16.966
we stand up for our workers,
for folks who are holding it
together during much of covid

00:48:18.502 --> 00:48:20.502
folks were quarantined and

00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:24.507
ordering their groceries and
ordering different things
through these apps and relying

00:48:26.710 --> 00:48:28.378
frankly on workers who are
putting themselves at risk for

00:48:29.747 --> 00:48:31.481
very little money and for very
little respect from the

00:48:33.650 --> 00:48:35.218
organizations that they have
made very wealthy.

00:48:37.154 --> 00:48:39.923
And it's important that we
change that that we make sure
that that's not the case any

00:48:41.391 --> 00:48:43.326
longer here in massachusetts.
So I think cancellara for her

00:48:45.950 --> 00:48:47.864
leadership here I think other
council colleagues who have
stood up on this and have been

00:48:49.233 --> 00:48:52.350
very loud on this and I think
council PRESIDENT Flynn for
this moment to share my
thoughts.

00:48:52.703 --> 00:48:55.238
Thank you.
That council.
Would anyone like to speak on

00:48:56.607 --> 00:48:58.875
this matter?
The chair recognizes councilor
block, councilor block.

00:49:00.711 --> 00:49:03.280
You have the floor.
Thank you so much, MR.
PRESIDENT and thank you to

00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:05.516
councilor laura for leading on
this councilor and I think many

00:49:05.516 --> 00:49:06.851
councilors are united on this
front.

00:49:09.286 --> 00:49:11.286
It was moving to see so many

00:49:11.555 --> 00:49:14.190
folks labor allies from across
the state outside of the
building earlier and I just

00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:18.461
really want to briefly
emphasize that what
councilor arroyo said about how

00:49:19.864 --> 00:49:22.165
there's nothing that prevents
these big businesses from
providing their workers with

00:49:23.734 --> 00:49:26.235
flexibility within existing
massachusetts labor law where
they don't like about existing

00:49:28.138 --> 00:49:30.573
massachusetts labor law is that
we have some of the best
protections for workers in the

00:49:31.442 --> 00:49:33.276
country and they're trying to
undermine those because they

00:49:35.379 --> 00:49:37.448
know that these are not outside
contractors, that they're
dictating far too much

00:49:37.448 --> 00:49:39.448
of people's work day for that

00:49:39.717 --> 00:49:42.519
to be the case.
They don't like the idea
of having to fund all of those

00:49:44.890 --> 00:49:45.855
protections so I just want to
emphasize you know, I think

00:49:46.824 --> 00:49:49.425
unfortunately if if we allow
this third category to be
created in the name

00:49:51.129 --> 00:49:53.463
of flexibility when in fact
it's just letting people be
workers without all of their

00:49:55.232 --> 00:49:57.100
workers rights, it's going to
hugely hurt our ride share

00:49:59.203 --> 00:50:01.204
drivers first and then it's
going to be a category that any

00:50:02.940 --> 00:50:05.576
number of workers in the
commonwealth could then become
sort of shunted into and lose a

00:50:06.744 --> 00:50:09.546
lot of their rights.
So I think it's just a super,
super important thing for

00:50:10.180 --> 00:50:12.820
worker power for all of us to
be pushing back on this and and

00:50:13.751 --> 00:50:15.820
making sure that massachusetts
voters know what it's really
about.
It's about the rich getting

00:50:15.820 --> 00:50:17.820
richer.

00:50:17.855 --> 00:50:19.689
It's about companies have
already basically set public

00:50:23.294 --> 00:50:26.290
transit and all kinds of other
things in their sights and sort
of like captured this big

00:50:27.164 --> 00:50:29.999
transportation market and now
they're trying to have as much
of the profit from that as

00:50:31.402 --> 00:50:33.370
possible go their way and not
to the workers who are in fact

00:50:35.373 --> 00:50:37.173
not even just the ones driving
but also the ones bringing the

00:50:37.942 --> 00:50:40.677
cars and paying the fuel and
stuck in terrible leases for a
lot of these cars being it's

00:50:41.845 --> 00:50:44.480
just it's a really exploitative
industry and this question
would make it even more

00:50:46.450 --> 00:50:48.619
exploitative and it's just
something we can't allow.
So thank you so much to my

00:50:48.619 --> 00:50:50.788
colleague and please hi.
My name.

00:50:50.788 --> 00:50:52.589
Thank you.
Councilor bok the chair

00:50:53.858 --> 00:50:56.793
recognizes councilor baker
councilor baker, you have the
forum.
Thank you mr PRESIDENT.

00:50:58.950 --> 00:51:00.630
Thank you councilor for putting
this one putting this forth

00:51:04.902 --> 00:51:06.938
uber in this is not our first
fight with them and I don't

00:51:06.938 --> 00:51:08.938
think it will be our last state

00:51:09.607 --> 00:51:11.475
they have been around for a
little while and I was involved

00:51:13.477 --> 00:51:16.120
pretty heavily and with the
taxi drivers we totally crushed
that industry there and that

00:51:16.681 --> 00:51:18.681
was mostly an immigrant driven,

00:51:20.452 --> 00:51:23.186
you know, sort of good american
story where you could get it
you could legitimately get a

00:51:24.989 --> 00:51:27.157
taxi and earn a living in that
in that taxi or one or two

00:51:28.326 --> 00:51:30.360
of them.
So we we lost that battle here

00:51:31.929 --> 00:51:34.970
and now they're coming after
kenzie was eloquent in what she

00:51:36.701 --> 00:51:38.680
talked about in taking away the
workers rights.

00:51:39.270 --> 00:51:41.137
So let's keep an eye on because
I think ultimately it's about

00:51:43.141 --> 00:51:45.742
it's about getting rid of those
workers and replacing them all
with automatic automated
vehicles.

00:51:48.245 --> 00:51:50.245
So but thank you for putting

00:51:51.115 --> 00:51:53.650
this forward and please let me
thank you.
Councilor baker, anyone else

00:51:55.353 --> 00:51:57.353

zero five four now I now
properly before the body
council brading you have the

00:59:49.729 --> 00:59:51.729
four.

00:59:54.660 --> 00:59:55.967
Thank you mr PRESIDENT As we
are in a very tight budget

00:59:57.736 --> 01:00:00.271
season it is difficult to
schedule committee hearings and
as monday's budget hearing with

01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:04.142
the strong commission had been
put has been postponed.
I would like to move these

01:00:05.711 --> 01:00:07.478
dockets a passage so that the
funds MAY be expended before

01:00:09.810 --> 01:00:11.149
the close of the fiscal year as
just outlined by the city for

01:00:13.319 --> 01:00:15.319
the these dockets are pretty

01:00:16.822 --> 01:00:18.822
self-explanatory and there and

01:00:20.926 --> 01:00:22.926
I move that we accept and spend

01:00:27.933 --> 01:00:29.933
these these sums to today I

01:00:31.737 --> 01:00:34.339
have been in communication with
commissioner emily chair say
from there from the strong

01:00:36.342 --> 01:00:38.342
commission and she's given us

01:00:39.111 --> 01:00:40.745
an outline on how this money
would be expanded.

01:00:44.116 --> 01:00:45.883
The strong commission receives
for twelve dollars per per

01:00:47.553 --> 01:00:49.420
elder per year and this is
currently based on the twenty

01:00:51.790 --> 01:00:53.625
2010 census for the number
of idiot thousand and and

01:00:55.594 --> 01:00:57.562
seventy persons and it's
possible that we will get an

01:00:59.532 --> 01:01:00.999
increase in funding following
this recent census.

01:01:03.836 --> 01:01:05.836
But this money will be used.

01:01:07.373 --> 01:01:10.275
It is flexible funding.
It will be used by the strong
commission for staff both

01:01:11.844 --> 01:01:13.844
salaries and fringe to support

01:01:15.114 --> 01:01:17.515
our communications advocacy
benefits access housing
support, volunteer programs and

01:01:19.885 --> 01:01:21.885
events, senior programing as

01:01:23.890 --> 01:01:25.390
well as other support of costs
like travel and telephones for
those staff members.

01:01:27.827 --> 01:01:29.561
In addition, they fund the
design, printing and delivery

01:01:30.329 --> 01:01:32.397
of the seniority magazine and
we have when we have additional

01:01:34.166 --> 01:01:36.134
when they have additional funds
they use the money to purchase

01:01:38.537 --> 01:01:40.371
they would purchase a new
senior shuttle vehicles from

01:01:42.742 --> 01:01:44.742
this funding source the other

01:01:46.512 --> 01:01:48.512
docket zero five three eight

01:01:49.315 --> 01:01:50.949
and it's really to support the
america americorps senior

01:01:53.152 --> 01:01:55.220
companion program which is a
program that has 55 volunteers

01:01:57.790 --> 01:01:59.357
serving in the program at
eighteen volunteer stations

01:02:01.428 --> 01:02:03.462
which are nonprofit partners
throughout the city and the

01:02:05.164 --> 01:02:07.310
volunteers must be aged 55 and
over and serve an average of 20

01:02:08.601 --> 01:02:10.669
hours per week.
They're very diverse group
of folks.

01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:14.873
They speak many languages and
support older and older adults

01:02:16.809 --> 01:02:18.777
who speak english, spanish,
cape verdean, creole, haitian

01:02:19.745 --> 01:02:21.880
creole and vietnamese and then
the other docket zero five four

01:02:24.250 --> 01:02:26.250
zero again that's an americorps

01:02:28.154 --> 01:02:30.154
grant and that will also

01:02:31.624 --> 01:02:33.291
support volunteers with me and
travel reimbursements.

01:02:36.128 --> 01:02:37.895
Um and you know, during the
pandemic they they lost a

01:02:38.564 --> 01:02:40.298
number of volunteers so they're
recruiting new volunteers for

01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:45.700
all the programs and we need we
want to support all of these

01:02:45.605 --> 01:02:47.605
programs.

01:02:49.742 --> 01:02:52.100
Thank you.
Thank you.

Ok we're on to consent agenda.

01:03:50.570 --> 01:03:52.237
moves for the option of the
consent agenda as presented.

01:03:54.173 --> 01:03:56.641
All those in favor say thank
you.
The consent agenda has been

01:03:58.311 --> 01:04:00.879
adopted announcements.
Does anyone have any
announcements at this time the

01:04:01.213 --> 01:04:03.448
chair recognizes
council cancellara you have the
floor.

01:04:05.651 --> 01:04:07.819
Thank you so much PRESIDENT
Flyn.
I want to make two

01:04:09.188 --> 01:04:11.123
announcements.
The first announcement is that

01:04:13.526 --> 01:04:16.194
my son zair who all you have
met and have had the pleasure
of have him disrupt our ways

01:04:17.664 --> 01:04:18.998
and means here is turning six
on friday.

01:04:20.333 --> 01:04:22.300
It's his birthday so I wanted
to wish him a happy birthday.

01:04:24.170 --> 01:04:26.305
It's you know, he's a fun kid
and I wanted to make sure that

01:04:26.305 --> 01:04:28.305
I honor him and also myself

01:04:28.875 --> 01:04:30.875
because six years ago I gave

01:04:32.178 --> 01:04:34.546
birth so my second announcement
is a little bit more solemn but

01:04:36.949 --> 01:04:38.817
my office did not have an
opportunity to send it in

01:04:40.987 --> 01:04:43.210
formally to the council for an
in memoriam just because of the

01:04:43.589 --> 01:04:46.558
timing.
But today and as we've all kind
of been keeping track of what's

01:04:47.928 --> 01:04:49.928
happening the news about ten
days ago we had the racist

01:04:51.898 --> 01:04:53.898
massacre of ten people in

01:04:55.368 --> 01:04:58.170
buffalo just yesterday we've
had the murder of nineteen
children and two educators in

01:05:00.730 --> 01:05:01.707
nevada texas and today is the
second anniversary of george

01:05:02.475 --> 01:05:04.610
floyds murder.
And so I wanted to respectfully

01:05:06.679 --> 01:05:08.880
request that when we close in
memoriam today that we do so in

01:05:10.550 --> 01:05:13.452
honor of all of those victims.
And I want to call on my
council colleagues to just take

01:05:15.540 --> 01:05:17.540
this as a recommitment to our

01:05:18.725 --> 01:05:20.592
work to black liberation, to
the safety of the people here

01:05:22.362 --> 01:05:24.362
in the city of boston.

01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:28.600
I know that this is unusual for

01:05:29.569 --> 01:05:31.603
the tone that I typically take
around these issues but the

01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:35.373
underpinnings of my work,
particularly around this is

01:05:37.544 --> 01:05:39.912
just a discipline of hope.
And I know that we can not only

01:05:39.980 --> 01:05:41.980
make our city our state but our

01:05:42.348 --> 01:05:44.716
country better for all of the
people here.
And although things might look

01:05:45.719 --> 01:05:48.254
gloomy, we are doing a lot
of hard work not only here on
the council but all across the

01:05:48.821 --> 01:05:51.256
country to make sure that all
of our people feel safe and
affirmed in their identity.

01:05:52.759 --> 01:05:54.593
So thank you, PRESIDENT.
Thank you, conselheiro.

01:05:56.630 --> 01:05:59.598
The chair recognizes councilor
.
We're all councilor.
We're all you have the year

01:06:01.267 --> 01:06:03.135
PRESIDENT Flynn and I just want
to say JUNE is national

01:06:04.905 --> 01:06:07.390

01:06:07.974 --> 01:06:10.242
two events.

01:06:20.253 --> 01:06:22.200
institute a caribbean studies

01:06:23.590 --> 01:06:26.325
importance of caribbean

01:06:28.595 --> 01:06:30.562
and then on friday will be

01:06:47.414 --> 01:06:49.150

Thank you.

01:06:50.517 --> 01:06:52.150
Thank you councilor earl the
chair recognizes councilor at

01:06:54.287 --> 01:06:56.722
royal councilor royal you have
the floor.
Thank you, councilor PRESIDENT

01:06:58.591 --> 01:07:00.459
Flynn and I'm sure many of you
I've found it difficult to

01:07:02.428 --> 01:07:04.428
concentrate today after the

01:07:06.232 --> 01:07:08.200
events in nevada texas followed
shortly after the events in

01:07:09.569 --> 01:07:11.569
buffalo, new york.

01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:15.740
I think we all share in the
horror of this.

01:07:17.611 --> 01:07:19.611
I think really hard about what

01:07:21.414 --> 01:07:23.582
we're doing as a country, as a
state, as a city when 19

01:07:27.420 --> 01:07:29.420
children can leave home and not

01:07:32.827 --> 01:07:34.827
return since the second largest

01:07:36.830 --> 01:07:38.697
element is school shooting in
our country's history, it's not

01:07:40.233 --> 01:07:42.233
even the largest.

01:07:43.603 --> 01:07:45.603
What does that say or does that

01:07:47.574 --> 01:07:49.574
say about us about what we're

01:07:51.678 --> 01:07:53.678
willing to tolerate, what we're

01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:55.915
willing to do to make sure that
children and teachers we're

01:07:58.685 --> 01:08:00.685
going to schools going about

01:08:02.422 --> 01:08:04.422
their day can go back home?

01:08:05.158 --> 01:08:06.693
I have nieces and nephews dan
lockdown drills.

01:08:10.300 --> 01:08:12.365
We have conversations about
arming teachers.
My mom was a teacher for thirty

01:08:12.365 --> 01:08:14.365
five years.

01:08:16.536 --> 01:08:18.504
My sister is a teacher now we
know that yesterday there were

01:08:20.907 --> 01:08:22.741
actually armed guards there.
There were people who fired

01:08:25.110 --> 01:08:26.712
upon this man to keep this from
happening and it didn't prevent

01:08:27.848 --> 01:08:29.114
it because that's not the
solution.

01:08:30.227 --> 01:08:32.853
The solution is ensuring that
we take make it harder to

01:08:32.853 --> 01:08:34.721
access these kinds of weapons
that would make it impossible

01:08:36.256 --> 01:08:37.656
in some cases to access these
kinds of weapons.

01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:41.861
And I'm hoping that in congress
and senate where we often hear

01:08:43.130 --> 01:08:44.897
about the other side and what
they're not willing to do that

01:08:47.534 --> 01:08:49.602
we take it upon ourselves where
we have the house and we have

01:08:49.603 --> 01:08:51.772
the senate, we have the
presidency to finally address

01:08:51.772 --> 01:08:53.772
these things because I can't

01:08:55.275 --> 01:08:57.275
imagine showing up to a school

01:08:59.790 --> 01:09:00.846
and waiting hours to be told
that your child isn't coming

01:09:05.452 --> 01:09:07.720
home with it's very difficult
to know that we have this

01:09:10.123 --> 01:09:12.240
happening at an unbelievable
rate to the point where it's

01:09:20.901 --> 01:09:23.170
like oh that was thursday, I
can't even keep track.
And so I'm hoping and praying

01:09:23.170 --> 01:09:25.337
for peace on the streets for
action.
But I imploring those of us who

01:09:25.705 --> 01:09:28.674
have the ability and leadership
to use their voices in this way
for people have the ability to

01:09:29.576 --> 01:09:32.411
take things to the floor, to
take them to the floor for
people to be able to vote to

01:09:33.380 --> 01:09:35.281
vote because we can't keep
living like this and we deserve

01:09:37.651 --> 01:09:39.652
better and so I would like to
make sure that we do close in

01:09:41.221 --> 01:09:43.221
the memory of those victims but

01:09:44.825 --> 01:09:46.692
that we also work tirelessly
for those children and all

01:09:48.161 --> 01:09:49.629
those that we've lost.
Thank you.

01:09:51.999 --> 01:09:53.733
thank you, councilor rachel the
chair recognizes councilor

01:09:56.303 --> 01:09:58.305
block councilor book.
You have the floor.
Thank you so much, MR.

01:09:58.305 --> 01:10:00.906
PRESIDENT.
Thank you for the ramlah.

01:10:01.141 --> 01:10:03.141
Um, I wanted to just highlight

01:10:04.511 --> 01:10:06.278
for councilors we've got the
first of the sort of focused

01:10:07.948 --> 01:10:09.915
topic area are hearings on
friday at 10:00 A.M. This will

01:10:10.817 --> 01:10:12.885
be the one focused on economic
inclusion, arts and culture and

01:10:15.355 --> 01:10:17.323
child care and sort looking at
the in greater depth of the

01:10:19.226 --> 01:10:21.327
administration's proposals and
kind of talking about our
interest.

01:10:23.130 --> 01:10:25.665
And we've got follow-up ones on
different topics JUNE 1st and
then to on JUNE 3rd.

01:10:27.101 --> 01:10:29.735
I just wanted to highlight for
colleagues that we did just
receive a couple of hours ago

01:10:30.938 --> 01:10:33.773
back from the administration
response to our fairly lengthy
and full request from the MAY

01:10:35.776 --> 01:10:37.543
3rd hearing and so I'm going to
be sending folks eighty two

01:10:38.512 --> 01:10:41.130
pages worth of bacca and I'm
mentioning that now because I
think one of the council's

01:10:42.383 --> 01:10:44.650
frustrations with budget
hearings has been really long
powerpoint presentation.

01:10:46.453 --> 01:10:49.388
So I asked the administration
to try to get us more of this
like chapter and verse detail

01:10:50.991 --> 01:10:52.992
for people to look at ahead and
try to have a shorter
presentation.

01:10:53.827 --> 01:10:55.628
But obviously that only works
if folks come to the hearing

01:10:57.397 --> 01:10:59.899
having looked at the backup.
So we will get that out in the
next hour.

01:11:01.335 --> 01:11:04.700
But just if people can try
before friday morning, don't
need to look at all of it

01:11:05.439 --> 01:11:07.406
before friday morning because
we're just focusing on arts and

01:11:09.276 --> 01:11:11.244
culture, economic inclusion and
the child care piece on friday.

01:11:11.278 --> 01:11:13.278
But if people could just try to

01:11:13.447 --> 01:11:15.450
find a little bit of time look
at that before I think it'll
make it a better hearing on

01:11:15.450 --> 01:11:17.384
friday.
So thank you, MR. PRESIDENT.

01:11:17.685 --> 01:11:19.685
Thank you.

01:11:21.422 --> 01:11:23.422
Council book.

01:11:24.458 --> 01:11:26.458
I just wanted to mention

01:11:29.263 --> 01:11:31.263
memorial day weekend is is upon

01:11:33.467 --> 01:11:35.467
us and it's an honor it's an

01:11:37.710 --> 01:11:39.710
opportunity for us to on

01:11:39.573 --> 01:11:41.507
memorial day itself is not
think about having a

01:11:44.278 --> 01:11:46.278
celebration or a cookout or or

01:11:48.820 --> 01:11:50.820
some type of party but it's

01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:54.520
about saying a silent prayer in

01:11:54.755 --> 01:11:56.823
memory of men and women that
were killed in service to our

01:11:58.592 --> 01:12:00.793
country.
So it's an opportunity for us

01:12:03.297 --> 01:12:05.297
to just stop and think about

01:12:05.566 --> 01:12:07.533
the men and women that never
came back after serving serving

01:12:17.845 --> 01:12:19.845
for our country memorials.

01:12:20.681 --> 01:12:22.715
