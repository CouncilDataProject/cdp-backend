# Ingestion Models

We try to make CDP infrastructure as easy as possible to set up while also allowing for
scaling to support as much specific data as can be given and processed.

To this end, our event data ingestion model can be seen below in two examples.
1. The bare minimum.
2. A filled out event with event minutes items discussed during the event attached.

The more data provided, the more data displayed and queryable from CDP services.

For more information on each field available, please see the
[object definition documentation](./cdp_backend.pipeline.html#module-cdp_backend.pipeline.ingestion_models).

## Updating Existing Database Documents

During the event gather pipeline, if an existing database document is found for an 
ingestion model, the content of the existing database document will be updated 
if there are differences between the ingestion and database data.

All non-primary fields of the database document will be overwritten with the 
value of the corresponding fields in the ingestion model.

If the ingestion model field is not provided or `None`, the database document's 
field will not be overwritten. 

## Minimal Event Data

Note: while this looks like a Python `Dict`, these objects are of type:
[IngestionModel](./cdp_backend.pipeline.html#cdp_backend.pipeline.ingestion_models.IngestionModel).

```python
{{ minimal_event_data }}
```

## Expanded Event Data with Event Minutes Items

Note: while this looks like a Python `Dict`, these objects are of type:
[IngestionModel](./cdp_backend.pipeline.html#cdp_backend.pipeline.ingestion_models.IngestionModel).

```python
{{ filled_event_data }}
```
